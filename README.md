Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository is hosting the R code for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course from Johns Hopkins University.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the collection, work with, and cleaning of this data set. 
The included R code cleans and binds the data together and creates a tidy text file at the end.

The data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" has been taken from UCI.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.
The run_analysis.R is the script that has been used for this work.  It runs off the data in my working directory. 
It can be used by anyone simply by changing the data source to the UCI website.
The result of the execution is that a tidy.txt file is being created, that stores the data 
(mean and standard deviation of each measurement per activity and subject) for later analysis.
